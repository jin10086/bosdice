        <p>Because of early dividends, community rewards and team tokens do not participate in the first dividend</p>

        <p>All follow-up bonuses are real-time. Whenever someone plays a game, 80% of the profits will be transferred directly to the prize pool and directly assigned to your account based on the pledge rate. </ p>
        <p>You can choose to withdraw your dividends at any time and your dividends will accumulate. </ p>
